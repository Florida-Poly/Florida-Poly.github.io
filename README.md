After the most recent website redesign, it became apparent to the author that there was a need for a functional website to host all of the links used by the Florida Polytechnic University community. A site was needed that would not change, but remain constant and reliable through the years in case the main site is ever rewritten again or taken down for some reason. The goal in mind is stability, which is why the site uses only basic HTML supported by all browsers and terminals.

Although this is not an official Florida Polytechnic website (It doesn't have the right color scheme) many of the links are to pages on the official website. There are also many links to websites that are not in the floridapoly.edu domain, but are used in university support. If there are any additional links you would like to see on this site, pull requests are welcome.
